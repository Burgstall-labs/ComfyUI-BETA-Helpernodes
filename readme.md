# ComfyUI-BETA-Helpernodes

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Custom utility nodes for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), providing helpers for tasks like video frame manipulation and advanced audio saving. Part of the "Burgstall Enabling The Awesomeness" suite.

*(Previously known as ComfyUI-BETA-Cropnodes)*

## Nodes

*   **Video Crop 📼 🅑🅔🅣🅐**: Crops a specified rectangular region from each frame in a batch of images (video frames). Includes an option to round the crop dimensions up to the nearest multiple.
*   **Video Stitch 📼 🅑🅔🅣🅐**: Stitches a batch of previously cropped frames back onto a batch of original frames using metadata provided by the Crop node.
*   **Save Audio Advanced 🔊 🅑🅔🅣🅐**: Saves audio data (received in ComfyUI's standard AUDIO format, or common dictionary formats) to disk as FLAC, WAV, or MP3, with format-specific quality/compression options.
*   **Clip to Sharpest Frame ✂️ 🅑🅔🅣🅐**: Analyzes the last N frames of an image batch for sharpness and clips the batch to include frames up to the sharpest one found (optionally skipping text/blank frames). !!!NOTE!!! The logic for this node was borrowed from somewhere on the internet, but as I had no intention of publishing this until it was requested, I didn't bookmark where I got it. If it's yours, please let me know and I will link and credit accordingly.
  
*   **Load Text Incrementally BETA**: Loads text files (.txt) sequentially from a specified directory. It uses an internal index that increments each time the node is executed, cycling through the available text files. It has an optional input to reset the index, and can filter for specific filenames.
## Features

*   Simple cropping of video frame batches.
*   Ability to round crop width and height up to the nearest multiple (e.g., 8, 16, 32).
*   Outputs crop information (`BETA_CROPINFO`) needed for precise stitching.
*   Stitches processed crops back into their original positions on the full frames.
*   Advanced audio saving to **FLAC**, **WAV**, or **MP3**.
*   Configurable options for WAV encoding (bit depth) and FLAC compression level.
*   MP3 saving uses the backend's default bitrate settings (user bitrate input currently ignored due to backend API limitations). *[Note: We may revisit MP3 bitrate control if torchaudio API stabilizes]*
*   Handles multiple common AUDIO input formats (standard tuple, wrapped dictionary, plain dictionary).
*   Uses ComfyUI's standard output directory and filename prefixing for saved audio.
*   Handles potential dimension mismatches and boundary conditions gracefully (for video nodes).
*   Analyzes image batch sharpness using Laplacian variance.
*   Clips image batches based on the sharpest frame within a specified trailing window.
*   Optionally skips frames with significant text-like features or mostly black/white content during sharpness analysis.
*   Outputs the clipped image batch and the index of the sharpest frame identified.

## Installation

1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory:
    *   Example: `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`
2.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Burgstall-labs/ComfyUI-BETA-Helpernodes.git
    ```
    *(Assuming this is the final repository location)*
3.  Restart ComfyUI.

Alternatively, you can download the `.zip` of this repository and extract the `ComfyUI-BETA-Helpernodes` folder into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory.

## Dependencies

*   Requires a standard ComfyUI installation (PyTorch, Torchaudio).
*   **OpenCV:** The `Clip to Sharpest Frame` node requires `opencv-python`. Install it via pip: `pip install opencv-python` (or ensure it's in your environment).
*   **MP3 Saving Requirement:** Saving to `.mp3` requires **FFmpeg** (usually including `libmp3lame`) to be installed on your system and accessible in the system's PATH. WAV and FLAC saving do not require external dependencies beyond torchaudio.

## Usage

### Video Crop 📼 🅑🅔🅣🅐

This node takes a batch of images and crops them.

**Inputs:**

*   `video_frames` (IMAGE): The batch of images (video frames) to crop.
*   `x` (INT): The horizontal starting coordinate (left edge) of the crop area (0-indexed).
*   `y` (INT): The vertical starting coordinate (top edge) of the crop area (0-indexed).
*   `width` (INT): The desired width of the crop area.
*   `height` (INT): The desired height of the crop area.
*   `round_to_multiple` (INT): Rounds the `width` and `height` *up* to the nearest multiple of this value. Set to `1` to disable rounding.

**Outputs:**

*   `cropped_frames` (IMAGE): The batch of cropped images.
*   `crop_info` (BETA_CROPINFO): Metadata used by the Stitch node.

### Video Stitch 📼 🅑🅔🅣🅐

This node takes original frames and cropped frames and puts the cropped section back.

**Inputs:**

*   `original_frames` (IMAGE): The original, uncropped batch of images.
*   `cropped_frames` (IMAGE): The batch of cropped images (e.g., after processing).
*   `crop_info` (BETA_CROPINFO): The output from the `Video Crop` node.

**Outputs:**

*   `stitched_frames` (IMAGE): The original frames with the `cropped_frames` stitched back.

### Save Audio Advanced 🔊 🅑🅔🅣🅐

Saves audio data (waveform and sample rate) to a file in the chosen format.

**Inputs:**

*   `audio` (AUDIO): The audio data coming from another node (e.g., TTS, Load Audio). Accepts standard `(tensor, rate)` tuple or common `{'waveform': tensor, 'sample_rate': rate}` dictionary formats.
*   `filename_prefix` (STRING): Prefix for the output filename (e.g., "output_audio"). ComfyUI adds date/counters automatically.
*   `format` (STRING): The desired output format. Choose from `flac`, `wav`, `mp3`.
*   `wav_encoding` (STRING, *optional*): For `wav` format. Selects the encoding and bit depth (e.g., `PCM_16`, `PCM_24`, `FLOAT_32`). Defaults to `PCM_16`.
*   `flac_compression` (INT, *optional*): For `flac` format. Sets the compression level (0=fastest, lowest compression; 8=slowest, highest compression). Defaults to `5`.
*   `mp3_bitrate` (INT, *optional*): *(Currently ignored)* Intended to set MP3 bitrate. Uses backend default due to API issues.

**Outputs:**

*   *(Saves file to disk in the ComfyUI `output` directory. Provides UI feedback with filename.)*

### Clip to Sharpest Frame ✂️ 🅑🅔🅣🅐

Analyzes trailing frames in an image batch (e.g., from video) to find the sharpest one, potentially useful for selecting a good frame after motion or transitions. Returns the batch clipped up to that frame.

**Inputs:**

*   `images` (IMAGE): The input batch of images.
*   `last_n_frames` (INT): How many frames from the *end* of the batch to analyze for sharpness.
*   `skip_text_frames` (BOOLEAN): If True, attempts to detect and ignore frames containing significant text overlays during sharpness calculation.
*   `skip_black_white_frames` (BOOLEAN): If True, ignores frames that are mostly black or white during sharpness calculation.
*   `black_white_threshold` (FLOAT): The threshold (proportion of pixels) used to determine if a frame is mostly black or white.
*   `show_debug` (BOOLEAN): If True, prints detailed analysis information to the console.

**Outputs:**

*   `clipped_images` (IMAGE): The image batch containing frames from the beginning up to and including the identified sharpest frame.
*   `sharpest_frame_index` (INT): The index (0-based) within the *original* input batch corresponding to the sharpest frame used for clipping. Returns -1 if no frames were processed (e.g., empty input).

### Load Text Incrementally 📼 🅑🅔🅣🅐

Loads text files (.txt) sequentially from a specified directory.

**Inputs:**

*   `directory_path` (STRING): The directory path where the text files are located.
*   `reset_index` (INT, *optional*): An optional input to manually reset the internal index back to the first file (e.g. connect a Primitive node with 0) - set to 0 to reset, 1 to advance without loading.
*   `filename_filter` (STRING, *optional*): An optional filter to only load files containing this text (e.g. to only load files containing 'prompt_').

**Outputs:**

*   `text` (STRING): The full text content of the loaded text file.
*   `loaded_filename` (STRING): The filename of the loaded text file.
*   `current_index` (INT): The index of the currently loaded file.





## Example Workflows

### Video Crop / Stitch Example (Face Analysis / Latent Sync)

This example shows how `Video Crop` and `Video Stitch` can be used in a more complex workflow, such as isolating a face identified by FaceAnalysis, processing it (e.g., with IPAdapter or LatentSync techniques), and then stitching the modified face back into the original video frames.
